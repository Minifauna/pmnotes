# Six Sigma (Agile)
## Agile and Six Sigma, how do they mix together?
### Introduction and Background
**Agile methods** have been the dominant project management style in software development in the last decade
Software development projects are considered **innovative knowledge work** as opposed to **task work** found in other domains such as manufacturing
Agile teams usually focus on quick/short-term improvements identified through either daily collaborations or retrospectives
**Six sigma** helps where Agile tends to fall short in the bird's-eye/global strategic approach
This article will detail how Agile methods were used in managing a Six Sigma project itself by adopting an Agile-based iterative and incremental method called "Process Increments"

### Six Sigma in Software Development
#### What is Six Sigma?
A structured methodology for process improvement and problem solving, offering a rich set of tools, techniques and roadmaps, whyich aim to reduce variation.
Reducing variation improves the quality of production processes by decreasing the number of defects (edge cases) and improving capabilities
